It allows you to quickly serve static files from any directory with customizable options, making it perfect for local development, file sharing, or simple hosting solutions.

Has **built-in tunneling** support with custom sub-domains for easy sharing of your local server through the internet by simply using command arguments.

Without installing globally, you can also use `npx` to run the CLI:
